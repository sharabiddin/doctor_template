## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone [repository-url]
```

2. Open `index.html` in your web browser to view the website.

## Customization

### Colors
The website uses CSS variables for easy color customization. You can modify the colors in the `:root` section of `style.css`:

```css
:root {
    --primary-color: #4a90e2;
    --secondary-color: #2c3e50;
    --accent-color: #e74c3c;
    --text-color: #333;
    --light-gray: #f5f6fa;
    --white: #ffffff;
}
```

### Content
- Update the content in `index.html` to match your information
- Replace placeholder images with actual images
- Modify the services, portfolio items, and testimonials as needed

### Form Handling
The appointment form currently shows success/error notifications but doesn't actually send data. You'll need to implement the backend functionality to handle form submissions.
